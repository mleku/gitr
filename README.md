# gitr

git for nostr

## about

gitr is a tool for most of the basic git operations normally done with the
mainline git that handles the additional feature of nostr signatures (see
[signr](https://github.com/mleku/signr)), as well as the main essential
operations, pull, push, tag, log, and so forth, with support for the
decentralised HORNET storage protocol.
